.Nm pam_af
.Nd Anti brute-force protection PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_af
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module for PAM, typically
.Pa /usr/lib/pam_af.so ,
provides functionality for PAM authentification category. The main purpose of
the
.Nm
module is to prevent brute-force attacks against protected services, like
SSH. Although, it is desirable for users to enforce strong passwords, weak
password's practice are still very common. In these cases brute-force attack
can be succesful. Also these attacks can mess-up system log with useless
records, and system administrator can pass something really important.
.Pp
The
.Nm
module is a shared object and can be loaded dynamically to provide the requred
functionality to application. The following PAM functions are implemeted in
.Nm
module:
.Bl -inset -offset indent
.It Fn pam_sm_authenticate
Use this function to check if the host can be authentificated or not. The
.Nm
module maintains statistics for each host, that tries to authetificate. It
stores the number of attempts and last attempt's timestamp. When called. the
authetification stage the
.Fn pam_sm_authenticate
function finds the configuration rule for given host and makes appropiate
decision using failed attempt's count from host statistics. If this
number exceeds configured limit, host would be rejected and blocked for time,
specified in the host's rule. Additionally, external command can be executed
in that case. It is useful, for example, to block the 'bad' host in
firewall.
.Pp
Simillary, if the
.Nm
module detects the block time has been passed, it unlocks host and executes
given external command.
.It Fn pam_am_setcred
This routine must be called after a successful login. The main objective of
this function is to clear the host's statistics. It zerofies the attempts count
and stores updated value in the backing storage.
.El
.Pp
.Sh External programs execution
As has already mentioned above, the
.Nm
module can execute external commands, when changing locked/unlocked status of
the host. The following enviropment variables would be set in addition to
standart PAM enviropment:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev PAM_RHOST
the hostname of the applicant
.It Ev PAM_RUSER
the name of the applicant
.It Ev PAM_USER
the name of the user the application is trying to authentificate
.It Ev PAM_SERVICE
the name of the requested service
.It Ev PAM_TTY
current terminal
.El
.Pp
.Sh Runtime configuration
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm debug
Report debugging information using
.Xr syslog 3
(at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level).
.It Cm no_warn
Suppress warning messages to the user. These messages include reasons why
the auth attempt was denied.
.It Cm allow_on_error
By default, the
.Nm
module declines the user's authentification attempt, if unrecoverable
error occurs. Specifing this option forces the PAM_SUCCESS to be returned
in this case.
.It Cm update_locked
specify this option to force the
.Nm
module to update host's statistics even if the host is locked. This can
increase module's overhead. This option can be useful if you wants the lock
time to be measured from the last attempt.
.It Cm sleep_on_deny=seconds
Use this option to sleep a time every time
.Nm
denies access.
The time is multiplied by the number of recorded login attempts.
.It Cm statdb=file
Use file as backing storage for the statistics databse. By default
.Pa /var/db/pam_af.db
will be used. Notice: .db suffix will be added, so if you want,
for example, to use
.Pa /tmp/pam_af.db
as backing storage, you must specify
.Cm statdb=/tmp/pam_af
as argument.
.It Cm cfgdb=file
Use file as backing storage for the configuration databse. By default
.Pa /etc/pam_af.conf.db
will be used. Above notice also has place.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /var/db/pam_af.db
default statistics database.
.It Pa /etc/pam_af.conf.db
default configuration database.

.Xr dbm 3 ,
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr pam.conf 5 ,
.Xr pam 8
.Sh BUGS
Host statistics is stored using hostname as hash key, so if the host has
several names, the statistics would not be accurate. Disable hostnames lookup
to avoid this.
.Pp
The PAM_RHOST and PAM_TTY enviropment variables would only be set, if previous
modules have defined it.
.Pp
Not all runtime options available on all platforms.
